usage: $name [directory|file]

Open a given directory or a file name with dired, defaulted to the
current directory.  If a non-directory is given, the point will be
automatically moved to the file on startup.

This command depends on emacsc(1).  Put the following lines in your
Emacs initialization file.

    (require 'emacsc)
EOF
}

sub main {
    my @options;
    GetOptions(
        "h|help" => sub { usage; exit },
        "n|no-wait" => sub { push(@options, "-n") },
    ) or exit 64;

        my $cwd = getcwd();
        my @files = @ARGV ? @ARGV : ($cwd);
